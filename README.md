# SceneChain

[![SceneChain CI](https://github.com/mahmoudelfeelig/SceneChain/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mahmoudelfeelig/SceneChain/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

SceneChain is a research prototype comparing manual password login with a
five-stage graphical passphrase. Each stage combines a location on a stable
full-scene image with a discrete directional action.

The experiment has three conditions:

- a manual password baseline;
- direct SceneChain, optimized for entry speed;
- shielded SceneChain, designed to retain location uncertainty after one
  observed login.

SceneChain is a knowledge factor. It is not phishing-resistant, it is not
multi-factor authentication, and it does not replace passkeys. Direct mode is
assumed compromised after a clear recording. Shielded mode is expected to weaken
across repeated observations. Those boundaries are part of the research.

## Core interaction

During enrollment, a participant receives five system-assigned CC0 cue scenes.
For every scene, the participant chooses any canonical cell
and one of four directions. During authentication, the user recognizes the five scenes
inside a shuffled public scene pool; the server never labels which scenes belong to the account. The five scenes
appear in the same order and the complete chain is evaluated only at the end.

Correctness-dependent scene branching is intentionally prohibited because a
known scene sequence would turn the next scene into a partial-password oracle.

Coordinates are normalized against an immutable 3:2 scene derivative and snapped
to a 24 by 16 grid. Raw pointer coordinates, freehand geometry, pressure, and
timing are not credential material.

## Run the prototype

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, replace every development secret, then run:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Open `http://localhost:8088`. PostgreSQL data persists in a named volume; Redis
is deliberately ephemeral because it stores attempts, enrollment state, rate
limits, and sessions. Stop the stack with `docker compose down`. Add `-v` only
when you intentionally want to delete enrolled development accounts.

For deployment, combine `docker-compose.yml` with
`docker-compose.prod.yml`, supply every required secret, and place the included
`deploy/Caddyfile.example` behind the loopback-bound frontend. The production
overlay enables secure cookies and separates Flyway's migration role from the
runtime application role.

Useful verification commands are:

```bash
docker compose config --quiet
mvn --file backend/pom.xml verify
npm --prefix frontend ci
npm --prefix frontend run lint
npm --prefix frontend test
npm --prefix frontend run build
npm --prefix frontend audit --audit-level=high
python3 scripts/validate_scene_pack.py scene-pack/v1/manifest.json
```

The Docker images are runtime images and intentionally omit Maven and Node.js;
run the source-level commands above locally or rely on the equivalent GitHub
Actions jobs. The integration workflow additionally starts a fresh Compose
stack, checks security-negative behavior while recruitment is closed, opens a
clearly labelled disposable local gate, and completes enrollment and
authentication before deleting the test volume.

The local-only scene reviewer binds to loopback and edits the staging manifest
only after explicit operator actions:

```bash
python3 scripts/review_scene_pack.py
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8091`. It supports independent crop and eligible-cell
approval and refuses to mark a pack approved until all 48 scenes have both
reviews. Recommended-cell metadata is retained only for offline analysis; the
participant interface exposes all 384 cells and never displays recommendations.
The application backend validates the frozen manifest plus canonical, delivery,
and thumbnail hashes independently at startup. A configured formal pack fails
closed if any check differs.

## Current status

The repository contains the complete in-scope research implementation:
versioned informed consent with an understanding gate, enrollment and two full
confirmations, server-assigned crossover state, direct, shielded, and password
trials, workload and retention flows, constrained secondary-outcome entry,
participant deletion, audited pseudonymised exports, Redis-backed single-use
attempts, PostgreSQL migrations, cryptographic test vectors, responsive public
information, desktop/laptop study UI, and a production-oriented Compose overlay.

The 48-image CC0 pack, protocol, policy, preregistration text, data schema, and
internal release evidence are frozen. The normative sources are `docs/protocol.md`
and `docs/protocol-conformance.md`.
Recruitment remains technically closed until the preregistration identifier,
pilot-derived duration, institutional contacts, compensation, hosting details,
written ethics decision, and written data-protection decision are complete and
recorded in the release gate.
